## üéØ Challenge and Approach

### The Challenge

Malaysia's cultural heritage is vast and diverse, but in the digital age, it is often overshadowed by short-form content and globalized trends. With Visit Malaysia 2026 approaching, there is a unique opportunity to reintroduce this rich heritage in a way that resonates with younger, tech-savvy audiences while supporting sustainable tourism.

### Our Approach

We designed **Jalan-Jalan Go** to:

- **Gamify exploration**: Using real-world geolocation, players must physically visit cultural or historical locations to unlock in-game rewards, making exploration fun and intentional.
- **Cultural immersion through design**: In-game characters (adorable animal mascots) wear traditional attire and are inspired by local folklore, enhancing cultural relevance and learning.
- **Sustain engagement**: Players collect digital items and feed their mascots with virtual representations of Malaysian food that can only be claimed at actual sites.
- **Modern tools for a heritage mission**: By combining React, Mapbox, AI-generated assets, and Three.js, we bring together performance and aesthetics to offer a seamless and engaging user experience.

This approach bridges traditional culture with contemporary tech, ensuring that heritage is not only preserved‚Äîbut experienced.
