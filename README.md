# Jalan-Jalan Go

**Jalan-Jalan Go** is a mobile-first web game inspired by Pokémon GO that encourages young people to explore Malaysia's rich cultural heritage. Players can visit real-world cultural and historical sites to collect adorable virtual animals dressed in traditional Malaysian clothing. They can also claim virtual food items at cultural hotspots to feed their animals, learning about Malaysia’s history, diversity, and culinary traditions in a fun, gamified way.

Built with Visit Malaysia 2026 in mind, Jalan-Jalan Go reimagines digital tourism through location-based gameplay, immersive cultural elements, and meaningful engagement.

## 🎯 Challenge and Approach

### The Challenge

Malaysia's cultural heritage is vast and diverse, but in the digital age, it is often overshadowed by short-form content and globalized trends. With Visit Malaysia 2026 approaching, there is a unique opportunity to reintroduce this rich heritage in a way that resonates with younger, tech-savvy audiences while supporting sustainable tourism.

### Our Approach

We designed **Jalan-Jalan Go** to:

- **Gamify exploration**: Using real-world geolocation, players must physically visit cultural or historical locations to unlock in-game rewards, making exploration fun and intentional.
- **Cultural immersion through design**: In-game characters (adorable animal mascots) wear traditional attire and are inspired by local folklore, enhancing cultural relevance and learning.
- **Sustain engagement**: Players collect digital items and feed their mascots with virtual representations of Malaysian food that can only be claimed at actual sites.
- **Modern tools for a heritage mission**: By combining React, Mapbox, AI-generated assets, and Three.js, we bring together performance and aesthetics to offer a seamless and engaging user experience.

This approach bridges traditional culture with contemporary tech, ensuring that heritage is not only preserved—but experienced.
